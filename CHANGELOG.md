## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **g8ee Model Serialization:** Introduced `UTCDatetime` type for all wire-facing datetime fields, serializing to ISO 8601 with `Z` suffix. Replaced custom `flatten_for_wire()`, `flatten_for_db()`, and `flatten_for_llm()` methods with Pydantic's native `model_dump(mode="json")` for boundary serialization. Added `SessionEventWire` and `BackgroundEventWire` models for SSE event contracts.

### Changed
- **Multi-Operator Batches:** `batch_id` correlation is now surfaced end-to-end — on `CommandExecutionResult`, approval metadata, and conversation message metadata — so agents and the dashboard can tie per-operator events and follow-up actions back to a single batched approval.
- **Task Tracking:** Task ID and TDTS tracking added for better correlation and debugging.
- **Setup Page:** Users can now reuse Gemini API key for Vertex AI search in the setup page.

### Changed
- **Batch Concurrency Safety:** `command_validation.max_batch_concurrency` is now bounded (1–64) at the model layer, preventing misconfigurations that could fan out to an unbounded number of operators.
- **Operator Selection Errors:** Multi-operator validation errors now clearly describe both single-host (`target_operator`) and batch (`target_operators`) targeting options.
- **Documentation:** `g8ed` docs updated to describe parallel batch fan-out with bounded concurrency and shared `batch_id` correlation.
- **Agent Autonomy Language:** Updated autonomy-related language to use more empowering terminology across prompts and documentation.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Cleaned up anti-patterns from prompts, synchronized verbiage, and refactored thinking support to handle multiple definitions.
- **Capability Handling:** Improved capability handling and thinking levels for agents.
- **Operator Panel:** Added collapse functionality and increased pagination to 20 operators per page.

### Fixed
- **Ollama Provider:** Fixed model selection, `num_ctx` configuration, error handling, and thinking parameter handling. Improved context window handling from Ollama responses.
- **Gemini Models:** Fixed Gemini 3 Flash model name in configuration.
- **Model Selection:** Fixed model selection dropdowns and UI collapsing issues across the dashboard.
- **Test Infrastructure:** Improved g8ee test fixes, added test parallelism support, and fixed various integration and unit tests.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- **Core Platform:** Open-source release of the `g8e` platform for AI-assisted infrastructure operations.
- **g8ee (AI Engine):** ReAct-based Python orchestration layer with support for Anthropic, OpenAI, and local Ollama models.
- **g8eo (Operator):** ~4MB dependency-free static Go binary for remote host execution. Features zero-inbound ports and outbound-only mTLS.
- **g8es (Data Store):** SQLite-backed persistence layer, KV store, and pub/sub broker running within the Operator framework.
- **g8ed (Dashboard):** Node.js central management console featuring FIDO2 WebAuthn (passkey) authentication and real-time mTLS gateway proxying.
- **Security:** "Tribunal Refinement Pipeline" utilizing stochastic swarm voting to validate AI-proposed terminal commands before human review.
- **Security:** Local execution vaulting to ensure raw stdout/stderr logs are securely encrypted and retained strictly on the target host.
- **DevOps:** Comprehensive `g8e` CLI wrapper for platform setup, testing, operator deployment, and CA certificate management.
